# Invisible-Cloak

🔍 **Project Highlights:**

**Technology Used:** Python, OpenCV

**Concept:** Real-time background subtraction to create the illusion of invisibility

**Inspiration:** Harry Potter’s Invisibility Cloak

📽 **How It Works:**

The project captures the background image first, and then, by using image processing techniques, it detects the cloak (a specific color) and replaces it with the background image, making the wearer appear invisible!

💡 **Challenges Faced:**

Achieving real-time performance
Ensuring accurate color detection under varying lighting conditions
Seamlessly blending the background

🔧 **Technical Details:**

Used color masking to identify the cloak
Applied image segmentation to isolate and replace the cloak area
Leveraged OpenCV’s efficient image processing capabilities to handle real-time video feed
This project was a fun and educational experience, blending my love for coding with a bit of wizardry. I’m excited to continue exploring more in the field of computer vision and image processing.
